#movieDB

This project provided a web interface (with its backend built in PHP) to a MySQL database of movie information: actors, movies, directors, and more. The interface, designed with Bootstrap, provides functionality to add director, actor, and movie information, and search for movie info and add comments and ratings to a movie.
